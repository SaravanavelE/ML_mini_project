# Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn. The model is trained on a sample dataset to classify target variables based on input features.

## Features
- Handles both categorical and numerical data.
- Visualizes the decision tree structure.
- Calculates model accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Files
- **DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb**: Contains the implementation of the decision tree model.
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `1_Decision_Tree/` directory.
2. Open the `DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Example Output
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Classification accuracy
- Tree visualization using Graphviz or Matplotlib
